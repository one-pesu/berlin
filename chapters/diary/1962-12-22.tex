\fraktursection{Berlin, 22 December 1962}

I have travelled through oceans of time, countless forgotten worlds, and the endless voids between, yet this air, crisp and biting, awakens a forgotten clarity within me.
It carries a memory, faint and elusive, of Barovia before the mists enveloped their suffocating embrace around my castle.
A sharpness to my thoughts returns, a hunger for control I had long believed dulled by millennia of repetition.

This time, it will be different.
This time, I will make her mine.

I am not the Land here, no.
The soil does not whisper my name, nor do the shadows answer my summons with the same fervent obedience.
But I will bend everything to my will.
This forest of concrete and steel, this unwelcoming and barren city, will be my domain.
And Tatyana, wherever she hides within its labyrinthine alleys and shadowed apartments, will be my queen.

Upon my arrival, there was another traveller.
An enigmatic figure, cloaked in an unsettling familiarity, who claimed to know the true me.
He spoke in riddles, mildly provoking, even joking about my ignorance, as if I were a novice in this eternal hunt.
He implied I am not the first to arrive here, that others have sought solace or power in these strange lands.
I had no time to entertain conflict.
My purpose here is singular, unyielding.
So, I let him go.

He provided me with the keys to a residence overlooking Alexanderplatz, a brutalist monument to human aspiration.
And an ID.
A service called ``Stasi,'' it reads.
My name is there, along with a number, and a department: ``Sondergruppe Dämmerung.''
This, he asserted with an unnerving smirk, is the best place to begin my search.
``No Vistani here, Fürst,'' he had whispered, ``you must find her yourself this time.''
